    <h2><u>MULTIPLICATION TRICK WITH 11:</u></h2>
    <p>
        When we multiply a two digit number with 11 the result 
        is the two digits on either side and their sum is in between them.
        </p>
        EG:23*11=2(2+3)3=253
        <h3><u>MULTIPLICATION TRICK WITH 9:</u></h3>
        <p>
            Let us take a n digit number multiplied by n digited number with all digits as '9'.Now subtract 1 from the chosen number,you have obtained haif of the answer now your next 
            haif answer is conjugate of the previous number number i.e. if 252 is number you got by subtracting 1 then 747 is conjugate by subtracting from 999 .You have reached the result.
            EG:271*999=270729
